> See the COURSEWORK specification on CANVAS for details of the group coursework criteria/deliverables


Create a GitHub repository for your project. Ensure that the repository is well-structured, organized, and follows industry best practices. 
For example:

```
- /data                # Store your datasets here
- /notebooks           # Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling
- /scripts             # Python scripts for data preprocessing and machine learning
- /documentation       # Project documentation, including weekly updates
  - /week1
  - /week2
  - ...
- README.md            # Project overview and documentation index
```


## Weekly Updates (GitHub Wiki)
Create a wiki section in your GitHub repository to document your project's progress. Each week, your team should provide updates on the project's status, including references and details of what you've accomplished during that week. Be sure to include the following in your weekly updates:

* Week X: Summary of what was achieved during the week.
* References: Any external resources, papers, or datasets used during the week.
* Challenges: Any challenges faced and how you overcame them.
* Next Steps: Plans for the next week.

Failure to demonstrate progressive updates may result in a grade penalty.
